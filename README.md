# Frontend Beginner Projects

This repository contains a collection of beginner-level frontend development projects, created as part of my portfolio to strengthen my skills in fundamental web technologies and tools. These projects were developed following best practices and focus on essential aspects of frontend development, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with additional tools that facilitate the creation of interactive and visually appealing user interfaces.


## Technologies Used

HTML: For the basic structure of the projects.
CSS: Including Flexbox and Grid for layout and element positioning.
Git: For version control and collaboration in development.


## Objective

The goal of these projects is to develop and demonstrate skills in frontend fundamentals, as well as to establish a solid foundation in web design and development principles. This collection is part of my frontend portfolio and serves as a stepping stone toward more complex projects.
